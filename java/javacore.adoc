== NIO
Link: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-nio/non-blocking-server.html

- *SocketChannel*: -- _for read_: return one block of message, even if message doesn't have just one block (1 block - multi messages or 1 message - multi blocks), need buffer incomming block waiting for message had arrived complete.
        -- _for write_: need check if have buffer to write in, number of bytes had writen, number of bytes had not.
- *ServerSocketChannel*
-- *.configureBlocking*(blocking:boolean).
- *Selector*: select one from set of Channel which is ready to use.
- *Basic concept*

== Concurrent
=== Core
- *ExecutorService*

[source,java]
----
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
----
- *Callable<T>* { public T call() throws Exception }

=== *Future* as _promise_
Link http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/02/javautilconcurrentfuture-basics.html

- *get()*: block until has st to get.
- *isDone()*: non-blocking, return true if can get() without block.
- *cancel(mayInterruptIfRunning)*:
-- true: interrupt even if Callable.call() is already in the middle, *_other waiting for Future.get() blocking method will throw InterruptedException_*
-- false: just interrupt Callables are being pending queue, hadn't started yet.

== Tricks

=== SuppressWarning

[source,java]
----
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
I imsg = (I) msg;
----
_[source] netty/SimpleChannelInboundHandler.java_
- avoid compiler fire a unchecked warning in generic code.
